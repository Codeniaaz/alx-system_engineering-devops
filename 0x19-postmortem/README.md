Issue Summary:
- Duration: May 10, 2024, 12:00 PM - May 11, 2024, 3:00 AM (UTC)
- Impact: Our web application experienced intermittent downtime, affecting approximately 30% of our users. Users reported slow page loading times and occasional errors when accessing certain features.
- Root Cause: A database deadlock occurred due to a misconfigured caching mechanism.

Timeline:
- Detection: May 10, 2024, 12:15 PM (UTC)
  - An engineer noticed an increase in error rates and alerted the operations team.
- Actions:
  - Investigated frontend and backend systems for any obvious issues.
  - Assumed initial root cause to be a network issue due to intermittent connectivity.
- Misleading Paths:
  - Initially suspected a DDoS attack due to intermittent service disruptions.
  - Investigated recent code deployments for potential bugs.
- Escalation:
  - Incident escalated to the database administration team and the development team responsible for the caching mechanism.
- Resolution:
  - Implemented temporary measures to alleviate the deadlock issue.
  - Scheduled an emergency maintenance window to reconfigure the caching mechanism and optimize database queries.

Root Cause and Resolution:
- Root Cause: The misconfigured caching mechanism caused database deadlocks by improperly handling concurrent requests.
  - The cache was set to expire too frequently, leading to excessive database queries under load.
- Resolution:
  - Adjusted cache expiration policies to reduce database load during peak usage.
  - Optimized database indexes to prevent deadlock scenarios.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Improvements/Fixes:
  - Review and optimize cache configurations across all services.
  - Implement more robust monitoring for database performance and query execution times.
- Tasks:
  - Update cache expiration policies to align with usage patterns.
  - Conduct load testing to simulate peak traffic and identify potential bottlenecks.
  - Enhance automated alerting for abnormal system behavior, including database deadlocks.
  - Schedule regular database performance reviews to identify optimization opportunities.

Conclusion:
The outage was caused by a misconfigured caching mechanism, leading to database deadlocks and intermittent service disruptions. By adjusting cache configurations and optimizing database queries, we were able to resolve the issue and implement preventative measures to mitigate similar incidents in the future.
