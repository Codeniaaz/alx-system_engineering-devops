The ISO/OSI model, also known as the OSI model, is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. These layers, from the lowest to the highest, are:

1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

Each layer has specific responsibilities, and the model aims to provide a clear separation of concerns to facilitate interoperability and standardization in network communication.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two transport layer protocols used for communication over networks.

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
  - Connection-oriented protocol.
  - Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
  - Uses a three-way handshake for connection establishment.
  - Supports flow control to manage data transmission rates.
  - Commonly used for applications where data integrity and reliability are crucial, such as file transfers and web browsing.

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
  - Connectionless protocol.
  - Does not guarantee reliable or ordered delivery of data.
  - Suitable for applications where low latency and quick data transmission are more important than guaranteed delivery, such as real-time streaming and online gaming.
  - It's a simpler protocol compared to TCP, with less overhead.

In summary, the OSI model provides a conceptual framework for understanding network communication, while TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols that operate within this framework, each offering different trade-offs in terms of reliability and performance.
